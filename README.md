# AI Poet: Recurrent Neural Network for Poetic Text Generation

## Overview

In this project, we embark on an exciting journey into the realm of artificial intelligence by creating our first AI project! This project is centered around a recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to generate poetic texts, reminiscent of the eloquence found in the works of William Shakespeare.

## Features

- Utilizes a recurrent neural network architecture.
- Generates poetic texts with a style inspired by Shakespearean literature.
